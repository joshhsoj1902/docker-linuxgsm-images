# Readme

This is based off the instructions [here](https://github.com/fbef0102/Game-Private_Plugin/blob/main/Tutorial_%E6%95%99%E5%AD%B8%E5%8D%80/English/Game/L4D2/8%2B_Survivors_In_Coop/README.md)

## Notes

After making yourself admin (layers/001-base/serverfiles/left4dead2/addons/sourcemod/config/admins_simple.ini). running `sm_muladdbot` in the ingame console will spawn in a bot survivor.

`sm_admin` will open the sourcemod admin menu. which might be usable to switching maps?
