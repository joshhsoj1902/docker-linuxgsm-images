This should be this plugin:
https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?p=2786925

But it doesn't currently compile

The git repo is also gone:
https://github.com/gabuch2/L4D2-Survivor-Set-Flow-Fix

But I found this repo that had a copy of what the code was:
https://github.com/siosond/left4dead2-coop-linux/blob/6eb50e614ec78095d78a2c5bd9de4a2dd57a3175/addons/sourcemod/scripting/l4d2_trigger_flow_fix.sp#L7
